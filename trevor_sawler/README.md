# Objectives of the course

- Testing is a critical part of the development process
- Well tested code is more maintainable, more secure, and overall takes less time to write.
- Go has a rich set of tools for testing built right in
- Won't use any third party testing packages at all (e.g., Testify)
- Write unit tests and integration tests

# First Project

- Write a simple command line program that takes user input.
- The program will determine whether or not a given number is prime.
- Write tests for that program.

# Second Project

- Build a simple web application that allows users to authenticate (securely).
- Write some middleware to check authentication, and to add some data to the context.
- Use the Repository pattern to make the code more testable.
- Write tests for all functionality, including integration tests.

# Third Project

- Write a simple REST API that allows authentication using JWT Tokens (stateless).
- Write some middleware to check authentication by looking at Authorization header for incoming requests.
- Create endpoints for typical CRUD functionality.
- Write tests for all functionality.

# Fourth Project

- Update REST API to include functionality that makes it useable with any Single Page Application (SPA).
- Add functionality to store JWTs and Refresh Tokens securely.
- Create endpoints for typical SPA functionality
- Write tests for all functionality.
